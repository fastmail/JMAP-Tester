0.102     2022-07-25 10:45:39-04:00 America/New_York
        - allow subclasses to change how JWT-authenticated links work
          (you probably don't need this!)
        - Stop acting like JMAP sessions contain an authenticationUri, because
          they don't!  This means: don't change the $tester->authentication_uri
          to be whatever you find in the client session.  You'll never find a
          defined value, which means you'll clobber the correctly-set value
          from initialization.

0.101     2021-08-13 11:02:38-04:00 America/New_York
        - work around bugs in older Role::Tiny; this is what you want if you
          saw: Can't use string ("-1") as a symbol ref

0.100     2021-08-10 12:11:55-04:00 America/New_York
        - [ THIS UPDATE MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE ]
        - The $jtester->ua object is now a "UA" object, not just an
          LWP::UserAgent.  This allows the use of other user agents.  More
          importantly, the tester can be configured to return Futures instead
          of immediate responses, which means it can be operated in
          non-blocking mode.  If you have been interacting with the result of
          ->ua directly, you should read the details of its new interface in
          JMAP::Tester::Role::UA and then update your code.

          These methods should make it easier to bootstrap your tester from a
          running server.

        - the Authorization header is now set only on specific requests, not on
          every request made by the tester's user agent

0.009     2017-01-28 13:54:00-05:00 America/New_York
        - an abort is now issued on bogus paragraphs and non-contiguous use of
          a client id; we can roll this back in the future if someone has a
          needâ€¦ but why would you?

          for use with Test::Abortable
